# LangGraph Agent Debugging Summary

## Current Behavior
- Agent successfully receives user input and processes messages
- Model correctly generates tool calls with proper OpenAI function call format
- Tool calls are detected and logged but execution chain stops after tool call generation
- No subsequent events (`tools` or `handleCommands`) are triggered after tool call

## Example Tool Call Structure (Working)
```json
{
  "name": "query_entities",
  "args": {
    "keywords": ["baseball"]
  },
  "id": "call_7euJMItAMxsVHZNNDrOKbuRB",
  "type": "tool_call"
}
```

## Event Flow
1. ✅ Agent receives message
2. ✅ Agent generates tool call
3. ❌ Tool execution (`tools` event) never occurs
4. ❌ Command handling never occurs

## Potential Issues
1. Tool binding configuration on the ChatOpenAI model
2. ToolNode configuration in the StateGraph
3. Edge connections in the graph for tool execution flow
4. Possible version mismatch with LangChain's tool binding API

## Required Information
1. ChatOpenAI model configuration
2. StateGraph setup (nodes and edges)
3. LangChain version being used
4. Tool binding method (`bindTools` vs `bind`)

## Next Steps
1. Verify LangChain version and appropriate tool binding method
2. Review StateGraph configuration for proper tool execution flow
3. Confirm edge connections between agent, tools, and command nodes
4. Add logging to ToolNode execution to verify if it's being triggered
