# UI Rules & Conventions for Deep Research Agent

This document outlines the structural, interaction, and behavioral conventions for the Deep Research Agent UI. It focuses on the layout, component behavior, accessibility (beyond visual styles), and integration with our tech stack to build an engaging, high-performance application.

---

## 1. Introduction

Deep Research Agent is built as a desktop-first, interactive platform guiding users from natural language query input to real-time research updates and detailed visualizations. These UI rules ensure a clean, organized, and responsive interface that aligns with the overall product strategy and user flow.

## 2. UI Structure & Layout

- **Modular Dashboard Layout:**  
  - Organize the interface into clear sections:
    - **Query Submission:** A header area or modal dedicated to natural language input and parameter configuration.
    - **Progress & Results:** A central workspace featuring real-time status indicators, summary cards, and detailed views.
    - **Interactive Discussion:** A panel for LLM-driven dialogs and follow-up queries.
    - **Post-Research Actions:** Areas for exporting data, saving insights, and providing feedback.
- **Desktop-First & Responsive Design:**  
  - Optimize for larger screens while defining responsive breakpoints (via Tailwind CSS) for tablets and mobile devices.
  - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for fluid and adaptable layouts, ensuring usability across various screen sizes.

---

## 3. Forms & Inputs

- **Input Fields & Configuration Controls:**  
  - Clearly labeled input elements (with accessible labels, placeholders, and tooltips) for research queries and parameter adjustments.
  - Ensure keyboard navigability with prominent focus states.
  - Leverage Shadcn UI components to maintain consistency and built-in accessibility.
- **Validation & Feedback:**  
  - Provide inline validation and clear error messages.
  - Use dynamic states (loading indicators, disabled states) to offer real-time feedback during user input and submission phases.

---

## 4. Interactive Components & Behavior

- **Real-Time Feedback Controls:**  
  - Integrate animated progress bars and status badges to visualize ongoing research efforts.
  - Use Tailwind CSS transitions to create smooth interactions (hover, active, focus) that signal responsiveness.
- **Dashboard Elements:**  
  - Implement interactive summary cards and detailed views which allow drill-down into aggregated research data.
  - Support toggling between various views (summary vs. detailed) to accommodate different user needs.
- **LLM Discussion Panels:**  
  - Design dedicated conversation spaces where LLM responses and user queries appear in a clear, scrollable format.
  - Enable users to refine the query flow through intuitive UI buttons, consistent with theme-defined call-to-action styles.

---

## 5. Accessibility & Interaction Guidelines

- **Keyboard Navigation:**  
  - Ensure all interactive elements are fully operable by keyboard with clear and consistent focus indicators.
- **ARIA Attributes & Semantic HTML:**  
  - Use appropriate ARIA roles and attributes on custom components to enhance screen reader support.
- **Responsiveness & Usability:**  
  - Maintain legible text sizes and adequate spacing in critical interactive areas.
  - Conduct regular accessibility audits to validate that interactions meet WCAG standards beyond color contrast requirements.

---

## 6. State Management & Data Synchronization

- **Efficient Updates:**  
  - Utilize Zustand for state management, ensuring that only the necessary components re-render during real-time updates.
- **Data Flow & API Integration:**  
  - Use Next.js API routes to seamlessly fetch and update data, keeping the UI in sync with ongoing research tasks.
- **Real-Time Notifications:**  
  - Implement status messages and badges to inform users of current processing states, errors, or completions.

---

## 7. Integration with Tech Stack

- **React & Next.js:**  
  - Build declarative functional components using React and integrate server-side operations via Next.js API routes.
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  - Apply utility-first classes for layout, spacing, and responsive behavior.
- **Shadcn & Radix UI Components:**  
  - Consistently use these libraries to enforce component-level accessibility and uniform interaction patterns.
- **Testing & Maintainability:**  
  - Adopt unit and integration tests (e.g., using Jest) to validate component behavior.
  - Follow ESLint and Prettier guidelines to ensure code consistency and readability.

---

## 8. Component Conventions & Best Practices

- **Modularity & Reusability:**  
  - Develop components as isolated, reusable units with clearly defined interfaces.
- **Code Consistency:**  
  - Use descriptive naming conventions and ensure functional components clearly separate concerns.
- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Implement lazy loading and code splitting for components outside the initial viewport.
  - Regularly profile and optimize interactions to reduce unnecessary re-renders.

---

## 9. Summary & Best Practices

- **User-Centric Design:**  
  - Build every UI component with the complete user journey in mindâ€”from query submission to interactive discussions.
- **Clarity & Efficiency:**  
  - Strive for a clean interface that minimizes distractions and maximizes responsiveness.
- **Continuous Iteration:**  
  - Regularly refine UI interactions and layouts based on user feedback and performance metrics.
- **Accessibility Commitment:**  
  - Ensure that dynamic interactions and structural changes are continuously evaluated against accessibility standards.

By following these UI rules and conventions, the development team will build a cohesive, scalable interface that meets the functional requirements of Deep Research Agent while delivering an outstanding user experience.
