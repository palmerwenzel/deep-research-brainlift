# Implementation

# Phase 2: Deep Research Module Implementation

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on enhancing the forked deep-research package to support local Firecrawl and Searxng integration, ensuring robust, testable functionality. We'll maintain the original repo's simplicity while adding necessary features for our project.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Local Firecrawl Setup (Days 1-2)
- [x] Add Firecrawl repository as a Git submodule in `services/firecrawl`
- [x] Configure Firecrawl environment:
  - [x] Create `.env` file with basic configuration
  - [x] Set up Redis for job queues
  - [x] Configure Docker services
- [x] Test local Firecrawl instance:
  - [x] Build and run Docker containers
  - [x] Verify API endpoint functionality
  - [x] Test basic scraping capabilities

### 2. Searxng Integration (Days 2-3)
- [x] Set up Searxng infrastructure:
  - [x] Add Searxng as a service in `services/searxng`
  - [x] Configure Docker container with appropriate settings
  - [x] Set up environment variables for search engines
- [x] Integrate with Firecrawl:
  - [x] Configure Firecrawl to use Searxng as search provider
  - [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for resilience
  - [x] Test search functionality end-to-end

### 3. Core Module Enhancement (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Analyze current `deep-research.ts` implementation
- [ ] Update configuration to use local services:
  ```typescript
  const firecrawl = new FirecrawlApp({
    apiUrl: process.env.FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL, // http://localhost:3002
    searchProvider: 'searxng',
    searchEndpoint: process.env.SEARXNG_URL
  });
  ```
- [ ] Enhance error handling for local service integration
- [ ] Ensure structured output format consistency
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all core functions

### 4. Testing Infrastructure (Days 6-7)
- [ ] Set up Jest with TypeScript support
- [ ] Create test utilities and mock services
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality:
  - [ ] Query generation
  - [ ] Result processing
  - [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] Local service integration

### 5. Documentation & Cleanup (Day 8)
- [ ] Update README with local setup instructions
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
- [ ] Create example configuration files
- [ ] Document testing procedures

## Technical Considerations

### Local Service Integration
```typescript
interface ServiceConfig {
  firecrawl: {
    baseUrl: string;        // For local instance (http://localhost:3002)
    apiKey?: string;        // Optional for local
    concurrencyLimit: number;
  };
  searxng: {
    baseUrl: string;        // Local Searxng instance
    engines: string[];      // Enabled search engines
    timeout: number;        // Request timeout
  };
}
```

### Core Function Interfaces
```typescript
interface ResearchParams {
  query: string;
  depth: number;
  breadth: number;
}

interface ResearchResult {
  findings: string[];
  sources: string[];
  nextDirections: string[];
}

type PerformResearch = (params: ResearchParams) => Promise<ResearchResult>;
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for local services
- Mock external services
- Test both success and error paths

## Success Criteria
1. âœ… Local Firecrawl and Searxng instances running and integrated
2. [ ] All core functions properly typed and documented
3. [ ] Test coverage for critical paths
4. [ ] Clear documentation for local development

## Dependencies
- Jest for testing
- Docker for local services
- TypeScript for type safety
- Existing deep-research codebase
- Redis for job queues
- Searxng for search aggregation

## Progress Notes

### 2024-02-19: Major Milestone - Searxng Integration Complete
- Successfully integrated Searxng with Firecrawl
- Verified end-to-end search functionality with test query
- Confirmed proper environment variable configuration:
  ```env
  SEARXNG_URL=http://searxng:8080
  SEARCH_PROVIDER=searxng
  SEARCH_ENGINES=google,duckduckgo,bing
  ```
- Resolved Docker networking issues between services
- Implemented proper fallback to Google search when needed
- Added extensive logging for debugging and monitoring

### Next Steps
1. Begin work on Core Module Enhancement
2. Set up testing infrastructure
3. Start documenting the integration process
4. Plan for potential scalability improvements

## Notes
- Keep changes focused on local integration and testing
- Maintain <500 LOC principle from original repo
- Document all configuration options
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Note: Local instances won't have access to advanced features (IP blocking, robot detection)
