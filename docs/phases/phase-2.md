# Phase 2: Deep Research Module

This phase centers on integrating or refactoring the open-source deep research engine (e.g., Firecrawl, Searxing, or similar) into our codebase as an importable, asynchronous module. It aligns with the “Deep Research Module” described in the PRD and project overview.

---

## Checklist

1. **Core Folder & File Setup**
   - [Backend] Create/Populate `src/deep-research/researchEngine.ts` with necessary functions (e.g., `performResearch`) that encapsulate the iterative/recursive search logic.
   - [Backend] Ensure these functions return structured results (JSON, Markdown, etc.) consistent with future front-end requirements.

2. **Local Integration (If Self-Hosting)**
   - [Backend] Integrate local Firecrawl or Searxing if required:
     - Configure them as local services (if not already) or confirm their presence in local dev environment.
     - Provide environment variables or config files for referencing these services (e.g., ports, endpoints).

3. **Refactor for Asynchronous Imports**
   - [Backend] Encapsulate the existing CLI or original code in asynchronous functions to avoid spawning processes repeatedly.
   - [Backend] Use `async/await` patterns and error handling best practices.

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - [Backend] Write unit tests verifying that `performResearch` returns correct data for sample queries.
   - [Backend] Mock local services if necessary (to test logic without external dependencies).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `src/deep-research/researchEngine.ts` provides a stable API for performing iterative research.
- Successful integration or local bridging with Firecrawl/Searxing.
- Unit tests confirm that mock queries produce expected structured output (JSON, Markdown, or both).

## Outcome
At the end of Phase 2, the core deep research logic—whether Firecrawl, Searxing, or another engine—should be wrapped in an asynchronous function (e.g., performResearch) that can reliably return structured results, passing unit tests and ready for integration into the broader application.
