# Phase 1: Basic Project Scaffolding

This phase focuses on creating the initial structure for the repository and setting up the core tooling (TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, linting, etc.). It establishes the baseline needed for future development phases.

---

## Checklist

1. **Initialize Project and Repo**
   - [Frontend] Create a new Next.js & TypeScript project scaffold.
   - [Backend] Configure package.json scripts for linting, testing, and local development.

2. **Core Tech Stack Setup**
   - [Frontend] Install and configure Tailwind CSS (including custom tailwind.config.js).
   - [Frontend] Install and configure Shadcn + Radix UI components for accessible UI building.
   - [Backend] Set up ESLint/Prettier for code quality and formatting across the repo.

3. **Basic Folder Structure**
   - [Frontend] Create `src/pages`, `src/components/ui`, `src/components/[PageName]` to align with standard Next.js structure and design guidelines.
   - [Backend] Create `src/deep-research` and `src/mcp` folders to hold placeholder files for the deep research engine and the MCP wrapper.

4. **Documentation Templates**
   - [Frontend/Backend] Add or update `docs/` folder with placeholders for Phase documents and ensure basic docs (codebase-rules.md, tech-stack.md) are added or referenced.

5. **Verify Development Environment**
   - [Frontend] Launch basic Next.js start script to confirm that Tailwind + Shadcn are correctly rendering example UI components.
   - [Backend] Confirm that ESLint/Prettier run without errors on the scaffolded directories.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The repository is structured according to our codebase rules (250 line limit, docs folder, etc.).
- A running Next.js app displays a simple “Hello World” or sample UI page.
- Linting and formatting tools run successfully without meaningful warnings.

## Outcome
By the conclusion of Phase 1, you should have a working Next.js + TypeScript project displaying a basic “Hello World” (or similar) page, along with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/Radix UI correctly integrated and verified linting/formatting rules.
