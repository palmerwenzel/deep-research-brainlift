# Phase 6: LLM Integration & Interactive Discussion

In this phase, we incorporate the **LLM-driven** interactive discussion that allows users to ask follow-up questions, request summaries, or clarify findings—reflecting the advanced dialogue flow outlined in the PRD and user-flow documents.

---

## Checklist

1. **Backend LLM Channels**
   - [Backend] Connect to the chosen LLM API (e.g., OpenAI).
   - [Backend] Create new module (e.g., `src/mcp/llmService.ts`) that:
     - Accepts research data or user queries.
     - Returns summarized or context-driven responses from the LLM.

2. **LLM Endpoint**
   - [Backend] Expose an endpoint (e.g., `/api/llm-chat`) to handle user chat requests (prompts, context, etc.).
   - [Backend] Integrate with existing or partial research data so the LLM has context for generating relevant responses.

3. **Frontend Chat UI**
   - [Frontend] Build a “Discussion” panel or modal (e.g., `src/components/[PageName]/DiscussionPanel`):
     - Displays ongoing conversation history.
     - Allows new user messages to be submitted.
     - Renders LLM-generated responses.

4. **Session or State Management**
   - [Frontend] Use Zustand or a custom hook to maintain the conversation state (chat messages, context).
   - [Frontend] Pass partial or final research data to the conversation context for relevant, data-driven replies.

5. **SpikyPOVs or Contrarian Advice (If Applicable)**
   - [Backend] Optionally parse the LLM response to highlight counterpoints or contrarian views.
   - [Frontend] Surface these in the UI for a more engaging user experience.

6. **Testing**
   - [Frontend] Verify that user messages are sent, LLM responses are rendered, and context is maintained throughout a session.
   - [Backend] Thoroughly log and handle errors (e.g., rate limits, invalid tokens).

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can open a discussion panel, type follow-up queries, and receive LLM-driven responses tied to the research context.
- The conversation is fluid, with proper error handling and minimal latency constraints.
- Contrarian or “SpikyPOVs” suggestions appear where relevant (if employing that feature).

## Outcome
When Phase 6 is finished, your application can handle user conversations through an LLM (e.g., OpenAI) and render dynamic follow-up queries in a chat-like interface. The system maintains context so users can discuss the research results interactively in near real time.
