# Phase 5: Real-Time Feedback & Aggregated Results Visualization

This phase enhances usability by providing **real-time progress updates** and **clearer visualization** of aggregated research outputs, aligning with the responsive feedback loop described in the user-flow and PRD.

---

## Checklist

1. **Progress Updates (Frontend)**
   - [Frontend] Implement a progress bar or loading indicator that regularly polls the server or uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) / WebSockets to display iterative research progress.
   - [Frontend] Build a “current status” view that reflects steps completed (e.g., 3 of 5 sub-queries done).

2. **Backend Progress Endpoint or SSE**
   - [Backend] Extend `src/pages/api/research.ts` or create a new endpoint (e.g., `/api/research/progress`) to provide incremental progress data if using polling.
   - [Backend] Alternatively, introduce server-sent events or a websockets approach for real-time updates.

3. **Data Aggregation & Parsing**
   - [Backend] Ensure the research engine returns partial or incremental results at designated intervals (if supported).
   - [Backend] Format partial results in a structure that’s easy to visualize on the frontend.

4. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - [Frontend] Replace plain JSON output with interactive UI elements (cards, lists, or a small dashboard):
     - Summaries, key points, or top-level headings.
     - Drill-down toggles for details.

5. **Error & Timeout Handling**
   - [Frontend] Handle scenarios where the research might take too long or fail unexpectedly. Provide user feedback or a retry option.
   - [Backend] Provide a mechanism to gracefully stop and return progress if certain steps fail or time out.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users see continuous or periodic updates of the research process.
- Visual components (cards or lists) render aggregated data in a more user-friendly way than raw JSON.
- Process can be canceled, retried, or gracefully times out without crashing.

## Outcome
By the end of Phase 5, real-time progress or incremental updates (e.g., via polling or SSE) are in place, and the frontend displays aggregated research data in a clearer, more user-friendly format (like interactive cards or lists) with error/timeout handling.
