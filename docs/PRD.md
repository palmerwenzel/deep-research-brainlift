  Aggregated research findings are displayed in a clear dashboard, with options to delve into details or initiate LLM-based discussions.
- **Post-Research Actions:**  
  Users can save reports, share insights, or annotate findings for team collaboration.

### Use Cases
- **Academic Verification:**  
  A researcher uses the tool to verify new literature and compile a literature review.
- **Market Trend Analysis:**  
  An analyst explores competitor strategies by querying and aggregating diverse market data.
- **Collaborative Exploration:**  
  A team collaborates on a complex problem, sharing interim reports and engaging in discussions via the integrated LLM interface.
